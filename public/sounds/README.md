# Background Sounds for Relaxation Widget

This directory contains audio files for the relaxation widget's background sounds.

## Expected files:
- `ocean.mp3` - Ocean waves sound
- `rain.mp3` - Rain sound
- `forest.mp3` - Forest ambience sound

## Audio Requirements:
- Format: MP3
- Duration: At least 30 seconds (will loop)
- Quality: 128kbps recommended for web

## Usage:
The relaxation widget will automatically load these files when users select background sounds. If files are missing, the widget will gracefully handle the error and continue without background audio.
